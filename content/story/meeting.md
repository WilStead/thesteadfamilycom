How we met is very funny. Both Jessi and Wil were in seminary training to be minsters. Actually, JESSI was training to be a minister while WIL was training to be a Catholic Priest. They took a class together at Baptist Hospital in Jacksonville, FL one summer (CPE) and became quick friends (along with the rest of their classmates).

<img class="article-photo" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9OoTCRKO5M0KykUkrCxU4nedobJl0znfW96PvJ1Q7HWmGWJk4revJGd4RJ_jyfJlP5r-ok2wrnr1sz8LH7qIbPtX5cftU6KK8X_l8rT3C4-ouxzi204bfSWpRPzs0jr4e5qX_3WaLF0=w512" alt="First Meeting" align="left" />They both admit on the first day of class they liked each other very much &mdash; but just as friends.
After classes ended they went back to their seminaries but stayed in touch through email over the next 8 years!!

One day Jessi got an email from LinkedIn saying Wil Stead wanted to connect and she was puzzled &mdash; why would a priest need LinkedIn? So, she emailed to ask how things were going and discovered 6 years prior Wil had left the seminary and gone back to school to be a Software Engineer.

Jessi was working as an Associate Pastor in her hometown of Jacksonville and Wil was just an hour away in Daytona Beach. They met up for their first reunion/lunch/date in St Augustine &mdash; a city they now call their favorite spot and the rest is history.
