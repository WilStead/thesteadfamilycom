The weather was lovely, the setting couldn't be more picturesque, and the bride and groom were both excited for everything that was about to happen.

The day was just as wonderful as they both had imagined. One special highlight was Wil's surprise presentation of an "adoption" certificate for Ella, Jessi's adored and adorable Dachshund.

Jessi and Wil were soon headed off to the northern California coast for their honeymoon, where they would cross an item off Jessi's bucket list: the famous Glass Beach.
