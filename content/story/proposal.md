The Christmas season is a hectic time of year for any pastor, and even in Florida the weather can get chilly and wet. So the very next day after Christmas was done, Jessi and Wil headed south, to spend a week in the tropical paradise of Punta Cana, in the Dominican Republic.

On the second night of their trip, he arranged for a private, moonlit dinner on the beach. Romance was in the air ... and then suddenly, so was the sound of the wedding reception in the clubhouse behind them!

Fighting past their laughter as the soundtrack to their romantic evening switched from the sounds of the ocean tide to the sounds of <cite>Yeah!</cite> by Usher, Wil got to one knee and proposed.

Jessi and Wil then spent an incredible week enjoying their tropical getaway together, knowing that one day soon they would be enjoying a wedding reception of their own.
